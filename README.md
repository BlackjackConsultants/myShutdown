# myShutdown
this is a console application that puts a computer to sleep. you can pass 4 parameters to make the pc sleep, hibernate, shutdown or restart.  the reason i created this application is because i removed all the buttons from windows so my family stops putting the computer to sleep.  This affected me because i was unable to rdp to it.
```
myShutdown.exe 
```
